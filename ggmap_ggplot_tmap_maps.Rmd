## Introduction

Data can express information to the audience but if we only use the table to view the data, we may miss some important information and misunderstand data. Therefore, we can turn to maps especially when the data has the columns of geographical characteristics like States, longitude and latitude, etc. Maps are used in a variety of fields to express data in an appealing and interpretive way. Maps can add vital context by incorporating many variables into an easy to read and applicable context.  
There are a lot of packages in R that can draw geographical maps. Let's explore these different methods to draw maps.

## Package ggmap
### Interpretation and Examples

When trying to make customized maps, we can use the `ggmap` package. It provides a way to download static data from Google map or an open-source map called stamen (open street map is not supported currently). We can simply use `ggmap::get_map` and `ggmap::ggmap` to plot a map of any given location. Notice that the Google Maps Platform now requires a registered API key, so we need to register our own api key before using `ggmap` functions which use Google's services. After acquiring your own api key and using `ggmap::register_google` to register your key, you can start to plot maps. For example:
```{r}
# register_google(key = "some google map api")
# ggmap(get_map("columbia university, new york, ny", zoom = 18, source = "google"))
```
![example of ggmap using google as source](./resources/ggmap_ggplot_tmap_maps/ggmap_example.png)

Of course, you can still uses `ggmap::get_map` to download static maps from stamen map (simply specify source = "stamen"). But you will need to provide gps coordinates of the lower-left and upper-right points. 
```{r}
get_map(c(left = -73.96846472489304, bottom = 40.80507481834089, right = -73.95616654510266, top = 40.81006172001067), 
        zoom = 16, source = "stamen") %>%
  ggmap()
```

### Combine With Other Plots
Since ggmap is based on ggplot, you can add all kinds of layer on tops of the map. And scatter plot goes along with ggmap very well, since the map usually has very high resolution and the area of the map can be customized, meaning it will be easy to see the exactly location. Furthermore, ggmap provides a very simple way to plot map with a scatter plot, using `ggmap::qmplot`, we can simply provide a data set, with each record containing a GPS coordinate:
```{r}
# define helper
`%notin%` <- function(lhs, rhs) !(lhs %in% rhs)
# reduce crime to violent crimes in downtown houston
violent_crimes <- crime %>% 
     filter(
         offense %notin% c("auto theft", "theft", "burglary"),
         -95.39681 <= lon & lon <= -95.34188,
         29.73631 <= lat & lat <=  29.78400
     ) %>% 
     mutate(
         offense = fct_drop(offense),
         offense = fct_relevel(offense, c("robbery", "aggravated assault", "rape", "murder"))
     ) %>% 
  select("offense", "lon", "lat")
head(violent_crimes)
# use qmplot to make a scatterplot on a map
g1 <- qmplot(lon, lat, group = offense, data = violent_crimes, color = I("red"))
g1
```

### Make it Interactive
And of course, you can also make it interactive very easily since it is still an ggplot object
```{r}
ggplotly(g1, tooltip = c("offense", "lon", "lat"))
```

### Comments
If you want to use ggmap, you will have to register with Google Cloud to get an API key and use `ggmap::register_google(key = "xxxxx")`. 

## Package ggplot
### Interpretation and Example
Of course, ggplot also provides its own function to plot maps, we can use `ggplot::geom_map`. But, the data needed to plot these maps are relatively hard to find. Package called `maps` provides some maps but the smallest granularity is states, meaning we cannot get more detailed information within each state.
```{r}
us_states.map <- map_data("state")
ggplot(us_states.map, aes(map_id = region)) +
  geom_map(color = "white", map = us_states.map) +
  expand_limits(x = us_states.map$long, y = us_states.map$lat)
```

### Combine With Other Plots
Since the map date we have generally comes in the form of dozens of polygons, heat map goes along with these kinds of maps very well. Using data containing each state's certain statistics, we can easily plot a heat map of the United State with the help of `maps` and `ggplot`
```{r}
data("state_stats")
states_selected <- state_stats %>%
  mutate(region = tolower(state)) %>%
  select(region,unempl,murder,nuclear)

states_map <- map_data("state")

states_selected %>%
  filter(region != "district of columbia") %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = murder)) +
  geom_map(aes(map_id = region), map = states_map) +
  expand_limits(x = states_map$long, y = states_map$lat) +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  labs(x = "", y = "", fill = "Murders\nper 100k")
```

### Notes
`maps::map` can also draw the geographical maps very easily. 
```{r, label="maps"}
maps::map("state")
```

## Package tmap
### Interpretation and Example
The basic building block is `tmap::tm_shape` (which defines input data), followed by one or more layer elements such as `tmap::tm_fill` and `tmap::tm_borders`. The data it uses are objects from a class defined by the sf, stars, sp or raster package. Luckily, package called `spData` provides some maps that we can use, but similar to `maps`, the number of maps is limited and the smallest granularity is states.
```{r}
tm_shape(us_states) +
  tm_borders()
```

### Combine With Other Plots
Similarly, we can also plot heatmap using tmap very easily.
```{r}
data("state_stats")
us_states %>% 
  inner_join(state_stats %>% select("state", "murder"), by = c("NAME" = "state")) %>%
  select("NAME", "geometry", "murder") %>%
  tm_shape() + 
  tm_fill(col = "murder", breaks = seq(0, 10, 2.5), interactive = TRUE) +
  tm_borders()
```

### Make it Interactive
And it is very easily to switch the generated map to an interactive mode using just one line of code. By default, the hover text is the first column of the input data. 
```{r}
# not run
#tmap_mode("view")
#tmap_last()
```

### Comment
`tmap` is based on the idea of a ‘grammar of graphics’, just like `ggplot2`. This involves a separation between the input data and the aesthetics. Therefore, it is not difficult for users who are familiar with `ggplot2` to learn it.
