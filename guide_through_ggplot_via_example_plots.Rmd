## Introduction

This community contribution is an outline of the key concepts in data visualization. I find that, to remind myself how a particular plot is created, I like to look for an example. From that example, I can see the key parameters that are used, as well as how the code is formatted. To that end, I decided to create a cheat sheet of sorts, with a rundown of all the major plots that I've been using recently. Each chapter contains a type of plot, with a few examples of that plot based on different common uses for it. Essentially, I just wanted a place where I could quickly access relevant examples for common plots that I may be using. I also added comments after most of the parameters to explain in words what that parameter is doing. That can make knowing which lines to alter easier to create the precise plot you are looking to create.

Creating this cheat sheet was really helpful for me personally. Not only does it now serve as a resource that I will reference myself, but even just writing the examples helped me get a more innate understanding of how the functions operate, including the type of data they require. Often times, I tried to use data in the examples that would not need to be downloaded. That meant either manually writing in a data frame, or using a very common data set in R, such as mtcars. Then, I would alter the data frame to fit a format that would be needed to suit the plot I was making. Understanding the type of data that needs to be used ended up making it much easier for me to understand how the plot worked.

Many of the examples are taken from lecture slides. That gave me a baseline to build upon. I then tried to comment on each line of the code. Additionally, I would sometimes use different data or slightly different syntax to try to make the plot more reproducible for someone who might not understand what certain parameters are doing. This is not meant to provide solutions to highly complex plots with really messy data. Instead, it is meant to serve as a baseline to understanding how some of these major plots work through examples, which is the way that I personally like to learn things.

In future iterations of this cheat sheet, I plan to add more types of plots, just to grow the database that this file will have. Additionally, I may look to have a more cohesive and thorough way to have different examples. Maybe I’ll need to create more examples in each chapter to illustrate differences, or maybe I don’t need as many, as simply listing the parameters and what they do is sufficient.



## Histograms

### Histogram by Frequency (Count)
Data from lecture slides

```{r}
df1a <- data.frame(x = c(35, 59, 61, 64, 66, 66, 70, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 76, 78, 79, 80, 80, 81, 81, 82, 82, 82, 84, 86, 86, 88, 88, 88, 88, 89, 89, 90, 91,91, 92, 92, 92, 92, 94, 94, 94, 94, 96, 98, 102))
g1a <- ggplot(df1a, aes(x = x)) + 
    geom_histogram(color = "blue", #color the border of the bars
                   fill = "lightblue", #color the bars
                   breaks = seq(30, 110, 10)) + #set the bins
        scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(30, 110, 10)) #set the x axis
g1a
```


### Histogram by Density

```{r}
df1b <- data.frame(x = rnorm(1000, 100, 10))

g1b <- ggplot(data= df1b, aes(x=x)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), #set to density
                 color = "blue", fill = "lightblue") +
  geom_density(color = "red") + #add density curve of the data
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean(df1b$x), sd = sd(df1b$x))) + #add normal curve based on mean and sd of data to see how it compares to the density curve
